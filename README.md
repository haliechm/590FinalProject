590FinalProject
UNC-590 Audio Propagation Final Project



**wip notes**

- Hunter script (in folder Assets -> A8Scripts) controls raycasting/collecting objects using enter key
- To change the ball that is being launced out go to Assets -> Resources -> MetalBall
- To change bounciness of ball that is being launched out got to Assets -> Resources -> BouncyBall
- BallLauncher script attached to FirstPLayer controls projectile being launched out (to find the script go to Assets -> Scripts -> BallLauncher)
- To make game object invisible just unclick mesh renderer
- Make the different rooms different materials (i made the one room all metal)


Need To Do:
- Need to add audio propagation to ball that is launched out ??
- Need to add more rooms/add more noise making objects
- Possibly have different types of balls shoot out/different materials)
