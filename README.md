590FinalProject
UNC-590 Audio Propagation Final Project

**Need To Do:**
- Add 3 more rooms (each made of a single different material)
- Add one collectible to each of those rooms (already made collectibles, but can just change audio source)
- Currenly collecting collectibles using raycast, but need to change to just collect it to when in certain range of object
- Could possibly change roll/hit wall sound (just used first ones i could find so could find better ones probably)
- User study/data analysis

**wip notes**

- Hunter script (in folder Assets -> A8Scripts) controls raycasting/collecting objects using enter key
- To change the ball that is being launched out go to LaunchedBall GO
- To change bounciness of ball that is being launched out got to Assets -> Resources -> BouncyBall
- BallSounds script (Assests->Scripts->BallSound) controls noises ball is making when being launched
- BallLauncher script attached to FirstPLayer controls projectile being launched out (to find the script go to Assets -> Scripts -> BallLauncher)
- To make game object invisible just unclick mesh renderer
- Make the different rooms different materials (one of rooms is currently all wood, and other is all metal)
